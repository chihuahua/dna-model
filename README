# A Simple Model for Predicting Protein Binding

This simple demo trains and evaluates a simple model for predicting protein binding. Data for this demo is taken from the [Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Predicting DNA-Protein Binding
](http://cnn.csail.mit.edu/motif_discovery) project at MIT.

Along the way, we log information within TensorBoard to gain insight into learning.

## Running the Demo

At the top-level directory for this repository, run the demo via the python interpreter:

```bash
python run_demo.py
```
